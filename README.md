# Oozie-Sqoop-Integration-for-data-download

A Sqoop job to download data from Oracle database through Oozie coordinator and workflows

This application is to create an oozie job using oozie coordinators and workflows which will trigger/execute a sqoop job. Using oozie coordinators, we can automate the schedule for data download.

<b>How to use :</b>

1. To create/start the oozie job use this command -> oozie job -config <application_configuration_file> -run

2. To kill/stop the oozie job use this command -> oozie job -kill <job_id>

3. Before starting an oozie job, one need to assign the OOZIE_URL like below ->

   export OOZIE_URL=http://testserver.pralay.org:11000/oozie

4. There are three files which will be used for oozie job configuration ->

   a) application_coordinator.properties (configuration file of oozie job)

   b) application_coordinator.xml (coordinator file for execution frequency of oozie job)

   c) application_workflow.xml (workflow file of oozie job)

5. There are five sections in application_coordinator.properties file.

   Section#1 contains distribution(cloudera/mapr) specific details.

   Section#2 contains location of coordinator and workflow files.

   Section#3 contains library file details.

   Section#4 contains application specific details.

   Section#5 contains timeline of oozie job.

   Currently in section#1, cloudera specific details are enabled and mapr specific details are disabled. One can toggle between them as per their requirements.

   In section#4, unit of coordinatorFrequency is in minutes.

   All the dependent libraries(of section#3) are present in dependencies folder in this repository

6. application_coordinator.xml file will contain application scheduling details. It will take coordination frequency from application_coordinator.properties file. This file will also refer to the calling application. This file will fetch "yesterday's" data. If one wants to change this default settings then one has to change the value of "runDateTime" property in this file. 

```
{coord:formatTime(coord:dateOffset(coord:dateTzOffset(coord:nominalTime(), coord:conf("timeZone")),<b>-1</b>,'DAY'), "yyyyMMdd")}
```

7. application_workflow.xml file will have workflow logics. We can have reference of multiple application along with calling application. This application uses oozieActivities application other than calling application(which is mentioned in appName & appClass variables inside section#4 of application_coordinator.properties file)

8. Sample oozie commands are below ->

   oozie jobs -jobtype coordinator [to check what all jobs are running]

   oozie job -config {location_of_properties_file} â€“run [to start a oozie job]

   oozie job -info {JOBID} [to see/monitor details of a job]

   oozie job -kill {JOBID} [to kill a job]

   oozie job -log {JOBID} [to check the log details of a job]
